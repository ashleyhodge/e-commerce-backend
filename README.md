# E-Commerce Backend
## Technologies Used
* dotenv
* MySqQL2
* Sequelize

## Description
 I am being tasked with creating the backend for an e-commerce website. I take Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with  a MySQL database.
 Hopefully, this will help this company compete with other e-commerce companies!

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
